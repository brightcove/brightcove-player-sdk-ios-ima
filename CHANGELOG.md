#### Additions and Improvements
* Fixes an issue that prevented FairPlay videos from playing on Apple TV. This only affected Video Cloud accounts using Dynamic Delivery.

## Release 6.1.1

### Brightcove Player SDK for iOS (Core)

#### Additions and Improvements
* Adds BCOVPUIAdControlView.h to the BrightcovePlayerSDK.h umbrella header to fix a compiler warning.
* Fixes an issue where code coverage symbols were present in the framework executables. This caused link errors in some build configurations.

## Release 6.1.0

### Brightcove Player SDK for iOS (Core)

#### Additions and Improvements
* Adds support for downloading and playing back clear (non-DRM) video content from Video Cloud accounts using Dynamic Delivery. Previously only FairPlay-protected content could be downloaded.
* Fixes an issue on iOS 11 where downloaded FairPlay videos would not play back until the app was restarted.
* The `BCOVVideo` class has a new BOOL `usesFairPlay` property that returns YES if the video contains a FairPlay-encrypted source. This only applies to videos retrieved from a Dynamic Delivery account.
* The `BCOVPlayerSDKManager` singleton class has a new `sessionID` property. This `NSString *` property is a unique read-only value that remains constant until the app is relaunched. This value is sent with all analytics reports and can be used to help diagnose playback issues. Please see the "Tracking Errors" section of the README for full details.
* The `BCOVPlaybackService` class has four new method for converting JSON response data from the Playback Service API. These methods are useful if you need to retrieve data from the Playback Service API (through a proxy server, for example) and then convert them to objects you can work with in the SDK. These methods work identically to the methods found in the `BCOVCatalogService` class with the same names:
	* `+ (BCOVSource *)sourceFromJSONDictionary:(NSDictionary *)json`
	* `+ (BCOVCuePoint *)cuePointFromJSONDictionary:(NSDictionary *)json`
	* `+ (BCOVPlaylist *)playlistFromJSONDictionary:(NSDictionary *)json`
	* `+ (BCOVVideo *)videoFromJSONDictionary:(NSDictionary *)json`
* The `BCOVPUIAdControlView` class is now fully declared in BCOVPUIAdControlView.h so that you can use the `BCOVPUIPlayerView` property `adControlsView`. Previously, `BCOVPUIAdControlView` was only a forward class declaration.


### FreeWheel Plugin for Brightcove Player SDK for iOS

#### Breaking Changes

* Release 6.1.0 of the FreeWheel Plugin adds support for version 6.17.5 of the FreeWheel SDK, which introduces several deprecations and new classes. As a result, the return type of `BCOVFWSessionProviderAdContextPolicy` has changed from `id<FWContext>` to `BCOVFWContext*`. Please see the "Quick Start" section of the FreeWheel Plugin README, and the iOS Player Samples, for full details.

## Release 6.0.6

### Brightcove Player SDK for iOS (Core)

#### Additions and Improvements

* The `BCOVPlaybackController` protocol has a new `usesExternalPlaybackWhileExternalScreenIsActive` property. Setting this `BOOL` property sets the similarly named `usesExternalPlaybackWhileExternalScreenIsActive` property of the current playback session's AVPlayer, as well as that of any subsequent sessions. This property has no effect if `allowsExternalPlayback` is false.
* The `BCOVPlaybackController` protocol's `-setAllowsExternalPlayback:` method has been turned into the `BOOL allowsExternalPlayback` property.

### IMA Plugin for Brightcove Player SDK for iOS

#### Additions and Improvements

* This release exposes the `HTTPMaximumConnectionsPerHost` property of the `NSURLSessionConfiguration` object used to construct the `AVAssetDownloadTask` which downloads a video for offline playback. Set this value when calling the `+initializeOfflineVideoManagerWithDelegate:options:` method of the `BCOVOfflineVideoManager` by providing an NSNumber value for the `kBCOVOfflineVideoManagerHTTPMaximumConnectionsPerHostKey` key in the `options` dictionary.

```

* CHANGELOG.md (this file) has been consolidated to include all Brightcove Native Player for iOS software components.

	* `BOOL canBeDownloaded`: Returns YES if this video object can be downloaded for offline playback
	* `BOOL offline`: Returns YES if this instance refers to an offline video.
	* `BOOL playableOffline`: Returns YES if this instance refers to an offline video playable from the device's local storage. Returns NO if the video has not completed downloading, or if the video has been purged and needs to be re-downloaded.
